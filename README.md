# multisrt

`multisrt` is a script that generates an HTML-based, merged view of multiple SRT subtitle files.

It's useful for intermediate to advanced students of foreign languages.
Such students can benefit from reading human translations of movie and television dialog.
Audiovisual media are full of speech in the colloquial register, which can be hard to
study using more traditional sources.

The output looks like this:
